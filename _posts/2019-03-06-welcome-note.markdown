**Hello Reader**. I will be posting my experiments with Deep learning and machine learning algorithms. I wil be writing over my expedition on computer vision, speech processing and recognition and latest research. I will also present my views on deep learing and its future. This blog will serve for tutorials, latest research by me, review of papers I read, Photography etc. I am very excited to write and interact with amazing readers like you.

**Stay Tuned!**
